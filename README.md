# SMS-Spam-Detection
SMS Spam Detection is a self-initiated machine learning project that focuses on identifying whether a given text message is spam (unsolicited and potentially harmful) or ham (legitimate and non-spam). The project addresses the challenge of classifying SMS messages into these two categories, contributing to enhanced user safety and experience.
